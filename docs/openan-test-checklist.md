# OpenAN Test Checklist

> Version: v0.1
> Based on: [OpenAN Integration Testing Process and Framework](https://lf-networking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenAN/pages/1544945667/OpenAN+Integration+Testing+Process+and+Framework) v0.1
> Maintained by: OpenAN Integration Testing Working Group
> Applicable to: feature handover acceptance (TRR), release testing
> Terminology: FIT (Feature Integration Test), SIT (System Integration Test), TRR (Test Readiness Review), RC (Release Candidate), TSC (Technical Steering Committee), WG (Working Group), P0/P1/P2/P3 (case and defect priorities, defined in Framework §2 and §9.1)
> Language: English

**Core principles: atomicity, repeatability, traceability, completeness, independence**

**Check items are normative clauses**: this checklist only defines "what to check and by which rule". Specific entry gate values are defined in Framework §8; test targets, scenarios, and content are defined in test plans / specialized test plans.

## 1. Feature Handover Acceptance Checklist (TRR)

| | Required | Failed case handling | [Rule] All failed cases have archived issues labeled `skip-temporarily`, per Framework §6.4 | ☐ |  |
| | Required | Performance baseline | [Rule] Key interface performance is not lower than the previous version baseline; baselines are defined in the specialized test plan | ☐ |  |
| | Required | Evidence retention | [Rule] Failure evidence (trace/logs/screenshots) is fully preserved, per Framework §6.3 | ☐ |  |
| Documentation & Archiving | Required | Plan & case archiving | [Rule] The test plan and case table are merged into the `integration-test` repo under `docs/plans/<version>/`, per Framework §11.3 | ☐ |  |
| | Required | Test code archiving | [Rule] Automated cases are merged into the `integration-test` repo under `e2e/<feature>/`; new environment variables are synchronized to `.env.template` and README, per Framework §6.6 | ☐ |  |

**TRR decision:**
- [ ] Pass, enter FIT
- [ ] Conditional pass (remaining issue list: ____; issue links: ____; risk acceptor: ____; latest closure version: ____)
- [ ] Fail, returned to development

**Review record:** review date ____; attendees ____; sign-off ____; evidence links (test report/pipeline/Allure) ____
